What is the Electron Cash wallet? Can you trust your coins to it?
Meh, I completely exited $BCH, it seems to be a rock finding the bottom
of the ocean.

A new Equihash-based Bitcoin fork called Bitcoin Gold is seemingly making it
irrelevant. $BTG is not code complete yet, but they seem to be an active
community on Github, and up front about their rough edges. The are still
implementing replay protection and they have assuring me on Github that they
will delay the launch of mainet if there is no replay protection. So they are
not tryingt to go the 2X route and fight to death in the streets to be the One
True Fucking Bitcoin. That will be another post.

In other news, the Hush testnet is coming along with many developers working on
it. It turns out that creating, and mining a new genesis block with all the
time constraints is non-trivial, go figure:

The main developer working in this will earn a 500HUSH bounty, so they must be
excited. We will have stable testnet servers that any Hush community members
can use to test new features and all kinds of awesome stuff. More details will
be released when we have stable hostnames and Github tags that make it easy for
people.

I have also been working on the Hush whitepaper, which I will dive into in
future posts. For now, keep your coins safe and decentralize in all directions!
