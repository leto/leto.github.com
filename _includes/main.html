I hack on <a href="http://fsf.org">Free (as in freedom) Software</a> because I know it makes the world a better place.
Proprietary software is only meant to exert force over those that use it, while
free software gives people the freedom to modify and learn from it.
</p>

<p>
Here are some projects that I hack on:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://parrot.org">Parrot Virtual Machine</a> - A virtual machine for dynamic languages</li>
<li><a href="http://perl6.org">Perl 6</a> - Perl 5's spunky little sister</li>
<li><a href="https://metacpan.org/author/LETO">Perl 5 modules on CPAN</a></li>
<li><a href="http://modules.perl6.org">Perl 6 modules</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pl.parrot.org">PL/Parrot and PL/Perl6</a>- Parrot and Rakudo Perl 6 in Postgresql</li>
<li><a href="http://bioperl.org">BioPerl</a> - Bioinformatics with Perl</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/letolabs/parrot-libgit2">libgit2 bindings for Parrot</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/leto/freeyourself">Free Your Self</a> - Jekyll-powered static website making it simple to take donations. The software that runs this site!</li>
<li><a href="http://cashmusic.org">CASH Music</a> - Helping musicians refactor the music industry.</li>
<li> Many, many more! You can see them all on my <a href="https://github.com/leto">Github</a>.
</ul>
<p>
If you want to support the development of any of these projects, then I would greatly appreciate a donation.

I also mentor students via <a href="http://code.google.com/soc">Google Summer of Code</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/gci">Google Code In</a>, which are
programs that introduce college and high school students to the world of Free
and Open Source software. I do this because I know it makes the world a better place.
</p>
<p>
I am always interested in giving <a href="talks.html">talks and presentations</a> about the various things that I hack on. If you would like me to talk about something at your user group, meetup, unconference, or whatever, please feel free to contact me.
