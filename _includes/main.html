I hack on <a href="http://fsf.org">Free (as in freedom) Software</a> because I know it makes the world a better place.
Proprietary software is only meant to exert force over those that use it, while
free + open source software gives people the freedom to learn and modify.

If you are interested in a more detailed description of some of my achievements, I have an <a href="/outline.html">outline</a> here.

<p>
I also mentor students via <a href="http://code.google.com/soc">Google Summer of Code</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/gci">Google Code In</a>, which are
programs that introduce college and high school students to the world of Free
and Open Source software. I do this because I know it makes the world a better place.

I am always interested in giving <a href="talks.html">talks and
presentations</a> about the various subjects. If you would like me
to talk about something at your user group, meetup, (un)conference, or whatever,
please feel free to contact me.
