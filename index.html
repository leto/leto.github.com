I hack on Free (as in freedom) software because I know it makes the world a better place.
Proprietary software is only meant to exert force over those that use it, while while
free software gives people the freedom to modify and learn from it.

<br/>

Here are some projects that I hack on, which you may want to support with a possibly
small, but always generous donation:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://parrot.org">Parrot Virtual Machine</a></li>
<li><a href="http://perl6.org">Perl 6</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bioperl.org">BioPerl</a></li>
<li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/~leto/">Various Perl 5 CPAN modules</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/leto/freeyourself">Free Your Self</a> - The software that runs this site!</li>
</ul>
